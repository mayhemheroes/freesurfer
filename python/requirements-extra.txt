# FOR RELEASE set this to version 0.2 (10/29/2022)
# pystrum==0.2

# voxelmorph

# these are also required for FS DL utilities, but we need some features
# that haven't quite made it into the stable releases yet - this should be
# updated once they do

# Update to newest commit that works with pip (10/29/2022)
# git+https://github.com/adalca/pystrum.git@8cd5c483195971c0c51e9809f33aa04777aa35c8
#
# But pip will not be able to satisfy the requirement that neurite needs pystrum
# version 0.2 or greater at runtime, so go back to allowing pip to find latest
# version on GitHub with empty "pystrum" above.  Also note pystrum currently
# has no dev branch so git+https://github.com/adalca/pystrum.git@dev does not work.

# neurite has a dev branch and pip will install using the latest commit and list the hash in the build log
# FOR RELEASE, set this to git hash from the nightly build (log) that has been tested
